    "description": "The International Coffee Organization forecasts a supply shortage of 3.5m 60kg bags of coffee for the year beginning in October, with output at 151.6m bags and consumption at 155.1m. This is despite record production of arabica coffee, the higher quality bean, thanks to bumper crops in Brazil, Colombia and Honduras. In comparison, prospects for robusta supplies were “less positive with lower crops expected from most major origins”, the ICO said. Predictions of a tighter robusta market this year come as coffee manufacturers and retailers face a decline in profit margins due to the cost increases. Robusta beans are primarily turned into instant coffee or blended with arabica to add a kick to the flavour as well as lowering the overall cost. JM Smucker, a leading US coffee manufacturer, this week said it would increase packaged coffee prices sold under the Folgers, Dunkin’ Donuts and Café Bustelo brand names by an average of 6 per cent. The company said the increase did not cover products on sale in Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. ",

    "description": "The Coffea arabica plant provides nearly three quarters of all the coffee consumed worldwide, so scientists are pretty interested in the plant’s genetic makeup. Today, researchers from UC Davis, funded by the international food company Suntory, announced that they had sequenced the genome of the plant and publicly released it for the first time ever. The genome sequence has been added to the Phytozome.net genomics research portal, making it available to other scientists and researchers working with the C. arabica plant. “We hope that the C. arabica sequence will eventually benefit everyone involved with coffee — from coffee farmers, whose livelihoods are threatened by devastating diseases like coffee leaf rust, to coffee processors and consumers around the world,” Juan Medrano, one of the UC Davis researchers, said in the university’s press release. The genome will also be presented on January 15th at the Animal Genome Conference, held in San Diego. Coffee is one of the many crops that may suffer greatly if global temperatures continue to rise. By releasing the genome sequence, the researchers hope that others working in the field will be able to develop new varieties of the plant that will be inherently disease resistant and produce greater yield even in the face of a changing climate.",
